To Do for beam tuning program.

1. Implement save and load features

2. Implement advanced graph controls (like the labview ones)

3. Implement data logging
    - All data goes into a h5 store - simple!

4. Change optimizer class to a widget rather than a Dialog
    - Enable having several of them at once with different subsets of the controls
    (of course only one optimizing at a time)

5. Optimizer functionality
    - Scan one voltage in a user-defined range
    - Scan two voltages in a user-defined grid
    - Optimize one/multiple voltage(s) with a simple linear optimization
        - How well this will work in real life... we will see. 
    - More advanced optimization (random walk stuff)

6. Advanced beam tuning aids
    - Save temporary configurations in memory for easy recall
        - very advanced: double-clicking on the tune graph to recall settings at that 
        point (requires a good implementation of point 3)
    - Grouping of elements to a single control
        e.g. combine the four elements of the triplet into one: increasing the voltage
        on this combined element increases one of the four and automatically optimizes 
        the other three for maximal current
    - Simple optimization recipes
        e.g. first tune element A, then B, then go back to A, etc.
